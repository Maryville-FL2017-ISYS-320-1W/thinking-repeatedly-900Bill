// 3. Were you correct? Explain any differences and what you learned.
//My statement was incorrect, the first (1) line was printed three times as directed
//the second line printed as normal because it did not have an assignment, but adding a
//line of for( int i = 1; i <= 3; i++ ) above the are printed would give the same
//result
